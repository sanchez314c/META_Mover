## üìñ Detailed Usage

### Media Organization Workflow

1. **Preparation**: Ensure all tools have proper permissions to read/write your media directories
2. **Selection**: Choose source directory containing your media files
3. **Destination**: Select or create destination directory for organized files
4. **Processing**: Let the tool automatically organize files by date and type
5. **Verification**: Review the organized structure and generated logs

### Date Correction Workflow

1. **Scan**: Use date fixer tools to identify files with incorrect dates
2. **Preview**: Review proposed changes before applying
3. **Backup**: Original files are preserved during the correction process
4. **Apply**: Execute date corrections with detailed logging

### Metadata Analysis Workflow

1. **Scan**: Use reporting tools to analyze metadata across your collection
2. **Export**: Generate reports in text or CSV format
3. **Analysis**: Review metadata patterns and identify issues
4. **Planning**: Use insights to plan organization and correction strategies

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- **Use SSD storage** for best performance with large collections
- **Close other applications** during processing to maximize available resources
- **Process in batches** for extremely large collections (>100,000 files)
- **Enable GPU acceleration** on supported systems for faster processing
- **Use appropriate tools** for your specific needs (don't use GPU tools for small collections)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `EXIFTOOL_PATH`: Custom path to ExifTool executable
- `METAMOVER_TEMP`: Custom temporary directory for processing

### Processing Options
Most tools support these common options through GUI:
- Source directory selection
- Destination directory selection
- Processing options and filters
- Output format preferences

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ExifTool not found**
- Ensure ExifTool is installed and in your system PATH
- On Windows, restart your terminal after installation
- Check installation with: `exiftool -ver`

**Permission denied errors**
- Ensure read/write permissions for source and destination directories
- On macOS, grant Full Disk Access to Terminal in System Preferences
- Run with appropriate user permissions

**Memory issues with large collections**
- Process files in smaller batches
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider using basic tools for very large collections

**GPU acceleration not working**
- Metal framework is only available on macOS
- Ensure you have a compatible GPU
- Fall back to CPU processing if GPU fails

### Getting Help

1. Check the error messages in the console output
2. Verify ExifTool installation and accessibility
3. Ensure sufficient disk space for processing
4. Check file permissions for source and destination directories
